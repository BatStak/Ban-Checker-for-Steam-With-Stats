This extension is mainly inspired by Ban Checker for Steam.

Load your matchmaking history (https://steamcommunity.com/my/gcpd/730?tab=matchhistorycompetitive) and find if players have been banned (VAC or Game ban). You can filter your games between short and long games.

I provide the list of banned players after playing with you and some statistics.

The most important statistics I wanted to add in the first place :
- number and pourcentage of matches with someone who has been banned after playing with you,
- number and pourcentage of players who has been banned after playing with you.
