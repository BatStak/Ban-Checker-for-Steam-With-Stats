Load your premier, matchmaking, wingman or csgo history and find if players have been banned (VAC or Game ban) after playing with you.
You can check on your friends, followed and blocked players too.

Right click anywhere on any webpage and you will see the menu to access directly to your match history or friends list.

You will see the list of banned players and matches are populated with ban infos.
We keep results in local database to avoid reloading the history every time.

CS2 history ban checker does not send or share any user data to the developer of extension and third-party. Extension communicates with Steam servers directly. All data are stored locally into the browser.
