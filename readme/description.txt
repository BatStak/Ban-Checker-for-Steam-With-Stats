This extension is mainly inspired by Ban Checker for Steam.

Load your matchmaking history and find if players have been banned (VAC or Game ban).  
https://steamcommunity.com/my/gcpd/730

I provide the list of banned players after playing with you and some statistics, including maps.

The most important statistics I wanted to add in the first place :
- number and pourcentage of matches with someone who has been banned after playing with you,
- number and pourcentage of players who has been banned after playing with you.

You can also check ban status on players reported, commends you received, your friends list, people you are following, recently played with and group members list.
