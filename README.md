# CSGO match history ban checker

This is a fork of [Ban-Checker-for-Steam](https://github.com/ge-ku/Ban-Checker-for-Steam).

I remove all the functionnalities about alarms, notifications, friends, group and followed players ban check.

I focus for now on improving analysing about https://steamcommunity.com/my/gcpd/730

- you can input date when loading history
- you can stop loading history
- add winrate statistic in the bottom left block
- add statistics about cheater pourcentage / match with cheater poucentage at the end of the scan
- add some options

I did not publish the extension yet and probably won't add it to Edge (too much pain). Only Chrome and Firefox.

Work in progress...
