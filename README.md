# Ban-Checker-for-Steam-with-Stats

This is a fork of [Ban-Checker-for-Steam](https://github.com/ge-ku/Ban-Checker-for-Steam).  

I wanted to add some statistics at the end, fix the "Load match history", being able to limit this functionnaly with a date input.

I may provide zip to load the plugin locally. Did not intend to publish it for now.

Work in progress...
