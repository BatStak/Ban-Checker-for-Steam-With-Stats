# CSGO history ban checker

This is a fork of [Ban-Checker-for-Steam](https://github.com/ge-ku/Ban-Checker-for-Steam).

The extension is published for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/csgo-history-ban-checker/pniajbbemhplaefaikpgfipmopopjeob) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/csgo-history-ban-checker/).

Load your matchmaking history and find if players have been banned (VAC or Game ban). You can filter your games between short and long games and ignore old bans for statistics.

I provide two main statistics at the end of scan :
- number and pourcentage of matches with someone who has been banned after the game,
- number and pourcentage of players who has been banned after the game.

Bans after the game displayed in red are more likey to be for CSGO. Older ones (yellow) can't be on CSGO.

You will find some personal statistics like K/D and winrate for each map.

I remove all the functionnalities about alarms and notifications.

And I remove for now the friends/group/followed players ban check. May add it back in future version.

I focus for now on improving analysing about https://steamcommunity.com/my/gcpd/730

What this version add to the original version :
- you can stop the history load and input a "max date" for history load,
- add statistics per map,
- add statistics about cheater pourcentage / match with cheater poucentage,
- add some options like filter games between short and long games.

Here are some screeshots :
